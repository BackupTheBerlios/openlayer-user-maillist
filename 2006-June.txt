Subject: [Openlayer-user] Loading OL bitmaps into an array
Message-ID: <c9004b820606181809rb9e489ax161db4a3628001cd@mail.gmail.com>

i've got a quick question.  i want to load an image into an array, but i'm
having a good deal of difficulty doing so with the OL bitmaps.  For some
reason my normal Allegro methods work fine, but it just doesn't want to work
with OL ones.
I have the following setup:

// Char.h
struct Char
{
     int x;
     int y;
     Bitmap *char_img[12];
};

// Graphics.cpp
#include "Char.h"
...
Char myHero;
myHero.char_img[DIR_NORTH1] = myHero.char_img.Load("Gfx/hero_north1.png");
myHero.char_img[DIR_NORTH2] = myHero.char_img.Load("Gfx/hero_north2.png");
myHero.char_img[DIR_NORTH3] = myHero.char_img.Load("Gfx/hero_north3.png");

When i attempt this, i get an obvious, Graphics.cpp expected
primary-expression before '.' token.  I have currently resorted to creating
a series of allegro bitmaps, and then converting them into OL ones, so i can
use the OL ones in my program.  This is quite a hassle, and a waste of
resources.  Anyone have any tips on howto properly load a OL bitmap into an
array like this?
Thanks.

Try this:
myHero.char_img[DIR_NORTH1]->Load("Gfx/hero_north1.png");
myHero.char_img[DIR_NORTH2]->Load("Gfx/hero_north2.png");
myHero.char_img[DIR_NORTH3]->Load("Gfx/hero_north3.png");

The load function returns a bool whether successfull or not, it doesn't return 
a Bitmap plus they are pointers.

Please respond to the mailinglist and not my address next time.
Your declarations should be done in your header, thus:
"using namespace ol" should be in Char.h not Char.cpp.

well no compiler errors, but i do get run-time access violations with that
setup.
